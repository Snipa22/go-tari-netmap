// This file wires this binary's own operational stats (see BRIEF4.md) into Prometheus
// client_golang, following the exact convention already established by this fleet's
// go-tari-observability-p2p/cmd/tari-p2p-exporter/main.go: gauge/counter vecs served on a plain
// net/http server via promhttp.Handler() at /metrics plus a minimal /healthz.
//
// Every metric here is incremented at the SAME call sites that already produce an equivalent
// log line today (see responder.go and main.go) -- this file only adds the counting, it does
// not change what gets logged.
//
// # Network-scoped metric names (see BRIEF5.md)
//
// Both mainnet and testnet deployments of this exact same binary get scraped into a single
// shared Prometheus backend, so every metric name emitted here MUST be prefixed by which
// network produced it: netmap_mainnet_p2p_responder_* on the mainnet deployment,
// netmap_testnet_p2p_responder_* on testnet -- Alex's exact instruction. That prefix is only
// known once the required -network flag has been parsed (see main.go), which happens in run(),
// AFTER package init() would already have run -- so, unlike the single fixed-name package-level
// `var (...)` + `func init() { prometheus.MustRegister(...) }` this file used to have, every
// metric here is now built by newResponderMetrics(network), called from run() after
// flag.Parse(), and threaded explicitly into main.go's ResponderConfig callback wiring and
// dbBackedResponder (see responder.go) instead of being referenced as package-level vars.
//
// newResponderMetrics also registers onto its OWN dedicated *prometheus.Registry, rather than
// the global prometheus.DefaultRegisterer: metric names are now a runtime value (dynamic per
// network), so two different responderMetrics instances constructed within the same process
// (this happens routinely in this package's own tests, which exercise both "mainnet" and
// "testnet" -- see metrics_test.go) would otherwise either collide (same network value used
// twice -- prometheus.MustRegister panics on a duplicate registration) or simply accumulate
// unboundedly on the shared global registry across every test in a single `go test` run. A
// dedicated registry per responderMetrics sidesteps both problems entirely and is exactly as
// correct for a single real, long-lived process (which constructs exactly one responderMetrics,
// once, for the lifetime of the process). collectors.NewProcessCollector/NewGoCollector are
// registered explicitly alongside our own metrics on that same dedicated registry, so /metrics
// still emits process_start_time_seconds/go_goroutines etc., exactly as before when those came
// for free from prometheus.DefaultRegisterer's own implicit registration.
